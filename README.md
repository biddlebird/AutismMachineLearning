To run this code, you will need to install the following packages. Here's a list of the necessary installations and the corresponding commands:

- **Pandas** - For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** - For machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.
- **Imbalanced-learn** (imblearn) - For handling imbalanced datasets (e.g., SMOTE).
- **Scipy** - Sometimes required by scikit-learn.
- **arff** - For loading ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) files.

```
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install imbalanced-learn
pip install scipy
pip install liac-arff
```
